I am happy to join with you
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp" target="_blank">today</a> in what will go down in history
as the gratest demonstration for freedom in the history of our demonstration

This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions
of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.
it came as a jouous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free.
